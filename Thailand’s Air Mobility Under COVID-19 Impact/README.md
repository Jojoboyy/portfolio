# Air Passenger Dashboard (Thailand 2020–2024)

This project is a Power BI dashboard focused on air transportation trends in Thailand, using passenger volume data from 2020 to 2024 (2563–2567).  
The analysis highlights key insights for air travel only — land and water modes were excluded from the visualization.

## Dashboard Objectives
- Visualize air passenger trends across different provinces and years  
- Identify top-performing regions in terms of passenger volume growth  
- Support strategic planning in aviation infrastructure and tourism  

## Data Sources
- `Dashboard.xlsx`: Cleaned and structured data for Power BI visualization  
- `passengers63-67.xlsx`: Raw data for all transport modes (air, land, water)  
  Note: Only air transport data was extracted and used

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel (Data preprocessing)
- Thai transport datasets (2020–2024)

## Key Insights
- Passenger numbers peaked in key airport provinces post-pandemic  
- Strong recovery in tourism-driven regions  
- Clear growth patterns in regional air transport demand
