# Optimization Modeling for Bicycle Infrastructure Planning (Master Thesis)

🚴 This project is based on my master's thesis research in transportation optimization.

📄 **Status**: Paper currently under review for publication.

## 🧠 Objective

This study develops a spatial equity–driven optimization framework to determine optimal locations for bike lanes and public bicycle stations. The model incorporates:

- A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation  
- A Multinomial Logit (MNL) choice model for multimodal behavior  
- Spatial equity constraints to promote fair access across zones

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Station placement is sensitive to demand near transit stations  
- Equity trade-offs emerge as user behavior shifts by θ parameters  
- Integrated planning enhances first/last-mile access while managing fairness
